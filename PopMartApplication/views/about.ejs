  <h2>About Us</h2>
  <p>
    We are building a blockchain-based marketplace that solves common e-commerce issues like
    delayed payments, payment disputes, and fake reviews.
  </p>

  <h3>Why Blockchain?</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Escrow Payment Automation:</b> Payment is locked in a smart contract and released only when conditions are met.</li>
    <li><b>Transparent Audit Trail:</b> Transactions are recorded on-chain and can be verified.</li>
    <li><b>Trusted Seller Reputation:</b> Ratings are allowed only after a verified purchase to reduce fake reviews.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>How Our System Works</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Buyer chooses a product and pays using MetaMask.</li>
    <li>Smart contract holds payment in escrow.</li>
    <li>Buyer confirms delivery → smart contract releases payment to seller.</li>
    <li>Buyer rates seller → rating is stored on blockchain and cannot be edited.</li>
  </ol>
